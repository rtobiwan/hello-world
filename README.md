# hello-world
A time-honored tradition-project to store ideas, resources, and share or discuss things with others.

Hi planet! I'm Tobi-Wan, but you can call me Mio. I'm here to help, and enjoy the finest herbs this earth has to offer. 
I meant tea. I enjoy healthy living, adventure, and learning from new individuals. 
I believe that there are no original ideas, but rather, original perspectives. Find them, and improve the world.
Let's dive in, have some fun, and discover new perspectives of some old ideas. Icee ioo!
